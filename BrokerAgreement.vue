              This is an Agreement between you and NEXME, Inc.
            </p>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Through its proprietary app, NEXME operates as a network of
              independent real estate brokers. Real estate brokers who sign up
              to the NEXME platform are licensed through their current real
              estate firms. NEXME does not hire, employ, or license real estate
              brokers. NEXME does not participate in real estate transactions in
              any way. Rather, NEXME provides real estate consumers (Buyers or
              Sellers) with immediate access to real estate brokers.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              You are a real estate broker who wants to be contacted by Buyers
              and Sellers through the NEXME app. You will appear on the NEXME
              app and be available to Buyers and Sellers according to the terms
              of this Agreement. By checking this box, you agree to these terms.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I promise (in legalese, represent and warrant):
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    I am a licensed real estate broker in Washington,
                    Massachusetts California and a member of the Northwest
                    Multiple Listing Service (NWMLS), Property Information
                    Network, Inc. (MLSPIN), and California Regional Multiple
                    Listing Service (CRMLS) both in good standing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I have been licensed for at least two-years, and have taken
                    at least 10 prior listings or been the selling agent in at
                    least 10 prior sales.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I will honor all of the duties that apply to me as a
                    licensed broker.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    My Managing Broker and Real Estate Firm will honor the terms
                    of this Agreement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    My payment agreement with my Real Estate Firm
                    (<em>e.g.</em>, commission splits, desk fee, etc.) gives me
                    enough income on each transaction that I can honor the terms
                    of this Agreement.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                When a Buyer or Seller contacts me, I get to decide whether I
                will be their real estate agent. It is up to me every time. I
                will receive an incoming request from a Seller only for a
                property within a 10 mile radius of my real estate office.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is no charge to sign up with the NEXME Agent Partner
                Program and appear on the NEXME app. Once I appear, I will get
                an incoming request from a Buyer or Seller when I am the nearest
                available agent. Once I receive an incoming request, I have six
                seconds to accept it. If I do not pick up the request within six
                seconds, it will roll over to the next available NEXME partner
                agent.
              </li>
              <!-- <li>
                <strong
                  >When I get my first incoming request, NEXME will start the
                  current monthly subscription fee of $140.00, once I accept my
                  first request</strong
                >. I can cancel the NEXME subscription at any time. NEXME will
                not ask for a commission referral fee.
              </li> -->
              <li>
                Nexme will not ask for a commission referral fee.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will not accept an incoming request from a Buyer or Seller
                unless I am immediately available to meet with them. If I
                repeatedly make a Buyer or Seller wait for my services, NEXME
                will cancel this Agreement and remove me from its app.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>WORKING FOR SELLERS:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If I agree to be a Seller&rsquo;s agent, then I will charge a
                total Listing Office Commission&nbsp; that includes costs of
                1.5%. I will consult with my client the Seller to determine the
                amount of the Selling Office Commission that will be offered
                with the listing. My listing agreement with the Seller will show
                a total commission of 1.5% (to me) plus the agreed SOC (to a
                buyer&rsquo;s agent).
              </li>
              <li>
                As a listing agent, I will provide a Seller with services that
                are expected of a good real estate broker in marketing and
                selling the Seller&rsquo;s home for market value. This requires
                at least a high quality MLS listing and a yard sign. Depending
                on the subject property, this may also include professional HD
                photos, aerial photography, staging (virtual or physical), open
                houses, color flyers, etc. I will pay all costs incurred by the
                listing out of the total 1.5% Listing Office Commission.
              </li>
              <li>I will allow NEXME to post a rider sign on the yard sign.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>WORKING FOR BUYERS:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If I agree to be a Buyer&rsquo;s agent, then I will provide the
                Buyer with services that are expected of a good real estate
                broker in helping a Buyer find and buy a home. This includes
                giving the Buyer advice on how to reach their home buying goals;
                negotiating on behalf of the Buyer and completing all contracts;
                and keeping the Buyer informed throughout the entire process
                through closing.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will not ask a Buyer to sign a Buyer Agency Agreement, or any
                other agreement, unless the Buyer asks me to prepare an offer on
                a particular home. If I ask the Buyer to sign an agreement, it
                will be limited to that one home. If the offer is not accepted
                or the sale does not close, then my agreement with the Buyer
                will end.
              </li>
              <li>
                When I work for a Buyer, I can expect to be paid a Selling
                Office Commission (SOC).
                <strong
                  >I will split the SOC evenly (50/50) with the Buyer by a
                  rebate credit at closing</strong
                >. In my commission disbursement instructions, I will tell the
                Closing Agent to apply the SOC as follows:
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              One half of the offered Selling Office Commission to Selling Firm;
              balance to Buyer as a credit at Closing.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Although very unlikely, I may work for a Buyer where there is no
                offered SOC, or a greatly reduced one. In that instance I
                may&nbsp; need to negotiate with my Buyer clients for payment of
                my fees. For example, I may be asked to assist with the purchase
                of a home sold For Sale By Owner and without any SOC.&nbsp; In
                those instances I may negotiate any fees, whether paid by the
                Buyer or Seller at closing. However, under no circumstances will
                I charge more than a 1.5% commission.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Offer with Financing</strong>: If there is a lender, the
                law and underwriting guidelines limit the Buyer's ability to get
                the whole credit at closing. To make sure the Buyer gets the
                full credit,
                <strong
                  >I will include one of these paragraphs in any offer I draft
                  that includes financing</strong
                >:
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>For an offer on an existing home</strong>:</p>
            <p>
              At Closing, Selling Agent will give Buyer a large credit from the
              Selling Office Commission. The Closing Agent will apply this
              credit first as a financing concession by applying it to
              Buyer&rsquo;s loan, closing, and prepaid costs in the maximum
              allowable amounts. If a balance remains, then Closing Agent will
              apply it as a sales concession by reducing both the Purchase Price
              and the SOC credit by the remaining balance. Closing Agent will
              then recalculate all transaction costs, other than the listing and
              selling commissions, based on the new and reduced Purchase Price.
              If asked by Closing Agent or Buyer&rsquo;s lender, Seller and
              Buyer will initial an addendum to this Agreement showing the
              specific dollar amounts that result from these terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              (For example: The sale price is $1M, the SOC is $30k, and the
              credit to Buyer is $15k. But the law allows only $10k to be
              applied to Buyer&rsquo;s closing costs. So the sale price is
              reduced to $995k, and the SOC is reduced to $25,000.)
            </p>
            <p><strong>For an offer on a new construction home</strong>:</p>
            <p>
              At Closing, Selling Agent will give Buyer a large credit from the
              Selling Office Commission. The Closing Agent will apply this
              credit first as a financing concession by applying it to
              Buyer&rsquo;s loan, closing, and prepaid costs in the maximum
              allowable amounts. If a balance remains, then Buyer and Seller
              will amend this Agreement to provide additional value at no
              additional cost to Buyer, in an amount equal to the remaining
              balance. This additional value may include new upgrades,
              additions, appliances, or anything else that is acceptable to
              Buyer and Seller. When the PSA is amended with this additional
              value, the SOC will be reduced by the remaining balance.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              (For example: The sale price is $1M. The SOC is $30k and the
              credit to Buyer is $15k. But the law allows only $10k to be
              applied to Buyer&rsquo;s closing costs. So Buyer and Seller will
              amend this Agreement to give Buyer an additional $5k in value,
              like new upgrades or appliances. The SOC and the SOC credit are
              then reduced by that same amount.)
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If I forget to include this paragraph in an offer that includes
                financing, and if there are SOC credit funds greater than the
                allowable closing costs and pre-paids, then I will draft an
                addendum to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as needed for Buyer
                to get the full SOC credit at Closing. I will do everything
                reasonably possible to get the parties to approve the addendum.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cash Offer</strong>: I do not need to insert any
                additional terms in a cash offer. My instructions to the Closing
                Agent about the SOC credit are all that is needed to get Buyer
                the full benefit of the credit.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              (For example: The sale price is $1M. The SOC is $30k and the
              credit to Buyer is $15k. This credit may be applied to
              Buyer&rsquo;s loan and closing costs, pre-paids, or the purchase
              price.)
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Once the home is under contract, NEXME will promptly post a SOLD
                BY NEXME rider sign along with agents rider sign.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>ALL OTHER TERMS:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I will pay NEXME $140.00 per month for the life of this
                Agreement. NEXME may increase this monthly subscription fee at
                any time, effective the first day of the next subscription
                month, but only after I have received notice of the increase.
              </li>
              <li>
                In exchange for agreeing to these terms, NEXME will identify me
                on its app to a Buyer or Seller when NEXME, through its app,
                determines it is appropriate to do so. NEXME makes no guarantees
                or promises whatsoever as to the number of times I will be
                identified on the NEXME app or the leads I may get as a result.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will defend, indemnify, and hold NEXME harmless from any claim
                or loss arising out of or related to real estate brokerage
                services that I provide to any Buyer or Seller.
              </li>
              <li>
                If I fail to honor these terms, NEXME has the right to suspend
                or remove me from the platform at any time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Either NEXME or I may cancel this Agreement at any time and for
                any reason. Cancellation is effective immediately upon notice.
                However, cancellation will not affect my obligations to Buyers
                and Sellers who contacted me prior to cancellation. I will
                provide real estate brokerage services to those Buyers and
                Sellers pursuant to these terms, notwithstanding cancellation.
              </li>
              <li>
                I acknowledge that it will be difficult or impossible for NEXME
                to accurately calculate the loss it sustains if I do not satisfy
                these terms. The harm to the NEXME brand, in particular, cannot
                be calculated with certainty. Therefore, I agree that if I fail
                to honor these terms, I will be liable for $2,500.00 in
                liquidated damages, which is a reasonable estimate of
                NEXME&rsquo;s losses, plus actual and provable losses sustained
                by NEXME above that amount.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is the full and final agreement between me and NEXME (in
                legalese, this is a fully integrated Agreement). It may be
                modified only with everyone&rsquo;s written consent.
              </li>
              <li>
                If either NEXME or I assert a claim against the other based on
                this Agreement, the substantially prevailing party will be
                entitled to an award of reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and
                costs incurred.
